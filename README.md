# Molecular Geometry Reviewer

This is a very simple command line based program that gives the user the number of bonding groups and lone pairs of electrons and asks for the corresponding molecular geometry.

## Instructions for PyCharm
An Anaconda environment with Pandas must be running in order for the program to work properly. Make sure that Anaconda is running _before_ starting PyCharm.

## Instructions for Repl.it
[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/RazeenHossain/Molecular-Geometry-Reviewer)](https://repl.it/github/RazeenHossain/Molecular-Geometry-Reviewer)
In order to simply run the program with Repl.it, go to [molecular-geometry-reviewer.razeenhossain.repl.run](https://molecular-geometry-reviewer.razeenhossain.repl.run/). If you want to create a repl, click the Run on Repl.it button above and change the language to Python, then click done. Then, delete the .replit file and click run. After automatically installing some packages, the program will run.
